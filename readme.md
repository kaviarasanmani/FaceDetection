# Advanced Face Detection System

## Overview

This project is an advanced face detection system implemented using FastAPI, OpenCV, and SQLAlchemy. It provides a web-based interface for user registration, face detection, recognition, logging, and basic analytics.

## Features

- User registration with face encoding
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- Face recognition using a simple Euclidean distance comparison
- Logging of face detection events
- Basic analytics dashboard with daily detection counts
- Responsive web interface using Bootstrap
- RESTful API for programmatic access

## Technology Stack

- Backend: FastAPI
- Database: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Face Detection: OpenCV (Haar Cascade Classifier)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Charting: Chart.js

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-face-detection-system.git
   cd advanced-face-detection-system
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. Use the navigation menu to access different features:
   - Home: Overview of the system
   - Register: Add new users with their face images
   - Detect: Upload images for face detection and recognition
   - Logs: View face detection event logs
   - Analytics: See daily face detection counts

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Home page
- `GET /register`: User registration page
- `POST /register`: Register a new user
- `GET /detect`: Face detection page
- `POST /detect`: Detect faces in an uploaded image
- `GET /logs`: View face detection logs
- `GET /analytics`: View analytics dashboard

## Configuration

- Database: The system uses SQLite by default. The database URL can be changed in `app/database.py`.
- Face Detection: The Haar Cascade Classifier is used for face detection. You can adjust the parameters in `app/face_detection.py` to fine-tune the detection.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.
